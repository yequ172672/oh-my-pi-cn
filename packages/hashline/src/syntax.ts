 * Syntax probe for candidate edit results, via the native tree-sitter parser.

 * Delimiter-balance arithmetic cannot tell a block closer from a `}` inside a
 * regex literal, a string, or Markdown prose. A parser can, so it holds veto
 * power over every repair whose justification is "this line closes a syntactic
 * block": when the edit the author actually wrote still parses, no such repair
 * may rewrite it. The probe never *forces* a repair — an unrecognized language
 * or an already-broken file simply yields no veto, leaving the delimiter
 * heuristics as the only available evidence.

 * path, an unrecognized language, or a native failure — because both mean the
 * probe has nothing to prove with. Callers must therefore never treat `false`
 * as evidence *about the edit*: it only withholds permission to rewrite.
 *
 * Uses `enclosingBlockBoundaries` over a whole-file window: no node can cross
 * that window, so the boundary walk is trivial and the tree-sitter parse is the
 * only real cost. It returns `null` for an unrecognized language and for a
 * source that fails to parse, which this predicate deliberately conflates.

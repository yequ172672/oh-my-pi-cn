# Memory Guidance
Root: memory://root
Rules:
1. Read `memory://root/memory_summary.md` first.
2. If needed, inspect `memory://root/MEMORY.md` and `memory://root/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
3. Memory: heuristics/process context; current repo files, runtime output, user instruction: factual state/final decisions.
4. Memory changes plan → cite artifact path (e.g. `memory://root/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) and current-repo evidence.
5. Memory disagreement with repo state/user instruction → stale; corrected behavior, then update/regenerate memory artifacts.
6. Confidence only after repository verification; memory alone NEVER sufficient proof.
